# AI-Music-Generator
AI-Music-Generator is a deep learning project that utilizes Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to generate music. It is trained on the Maestro dataset from Google, which consists of a large collection of classical piano performances.
This project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of artificial intelligence in creating original music compositions. By leveraging the power of deep learning and the Maestro dataset, the AI-Music-Generator can generate unique musical pieces that mimic the style and structure of classical piano compositions.
